//! macOS builds with the `browser` feature run CEF in windowed mode: each page
//! is a native child view over GPUI's Metal view, kept on its block's bounds
//! every frame (native.rs, view.rs, runtime.rs). Every other build has the
//! same API with no browser behind it: blocks show a placeholder and the
//! commands say what's missing (off.rs). The window only talks to `Browsers`.
